# COVID-19-CHROME-EXTENSION

This is a <strong>Chrome Extension</strong> which will <em>Rainbow</em> colour and animate the text "Coronovirus" wherever it is present in any of the URL's you visit. The Chrome Extension is yet to be published because i don't have Chrome Webstore registered account and it's charging $5 for one time registration. So , yeah i will try to get it published as soon as possible maybe be before the lockdown ends XD.
